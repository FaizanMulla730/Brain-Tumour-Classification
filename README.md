# Brain-Tumour-Classification  

Hello and Welcome to my Project based on "Brain Tumour Detection and Classification Using CNN Model."

In this project a "Multiclass Classification" is carried out over the input set of "Brain Tumour MRI Images."

### The output of the classififcation Model is as following:
  1.Normal Brain
  
  2.Glioma Brain Tumour
  
  3.Meningioma Brain Tumour 
  
  4.Pituitary Brain Tumour.
  
  
### Training of the CNN Model includes:
    1.Convolution 2D 
    2.Max-Pooling
    3.Fully Connected. 
    
    Implementation of the project:
    1.Inputting a Image File from MRI Images Dataset. 
    2.Applying Image Preprocessing.
    3.Conversion of this Image from RGB Scale to Grey Scale. (Thresholding and TFI-DF)
    4.Performing CNN Prediction.
    5.Output Displayed along with the Time Elapsed for carrying out the prediction. 
    
 Also the GUI is provided for portraiyng the Front end TKinter files including Login, Registration and Training and Testing (Prediction).
 The Backend Connectivity utilized in the project is MySQLite 3.  
 
 I hope this project continues to inspire its future development in building more efficient ML Classifiers.
